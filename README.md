## ✨ About Me
I'm a high school student in **Brazil**, majoring in Systems Analysis and Development, currently working as an intern in this area. I'm on a journey to make technology more impactful, inclusive, and accessible, and I love exploring different facets of programming! 

### 🎇 My favorite tools and languages:
- **Languages & Frameworks**: Java, Python, Kotlin (learning!), React, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Spring
- **Databases**: MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Neo4j, Redis
- **DevOps & Cloud**: CI/CD, Docker, GitHub Actions, AWS, Firebase
- **Other Tools**: Android, Swagger, Linux, Windows

Beyond coding, I love immersing myself in books, experimenting in the kitchen, sketching, and dancing whenever I get the chance!

## 🌟 What I'm Learning Now
Currently, I'm diving deeper into **Kotlin** to enhance my skills in mobile development. With a growing curiosity for backend and DevOps, I'm also exploring how to use these skills in real-world projects, while also exploring best practices in software development.

## 💫 Fun Fact
✨ I believe that coding is an art form, much like dancing or drawing — and, like art, it’s always more meaningful when it’s shared with others.
